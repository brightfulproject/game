When done. Tell the group that as they go around the room, each person must tell a fact or something about themselves for each square of TP they took.
Birthday Game
Have the group stand and line up in a straight line.
After they are in line, tell them to re-arrange the line so that they are in line by their birthday. January 1 on one end and December 31 at the other end. The catch is that they must do all this without talking or writing anything down.
