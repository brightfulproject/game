Toilet Paper Game
Pass around a roll of toilet paper to the group and ask them to take what they need. No further explanation.
When done. Tell the group that as they go around the room, each person must tell a fact or something about themselves for each square of TP they took.
Birthday Game
Have the group stand and line up in a straight line.
After they are in line, tell them to re-arrange the line so that they are in line by their birthday. January 1 on one end and December 31 at the other end. The catch is that they must do all this without talking or writing anything down.
